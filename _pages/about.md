Currently, I am a PhD Student in the Haller lab at TU Munich. We study the role of the microbiome and cell stress in chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's Disease and Colorectal cancer (CRC). 

My research focuses mainly on identifying microbial factors driving CRC, using a novel model of [colonic tumorogenesis](https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(18)34816-9/fulltext?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F30063920-activated-atf6-induces-intestinal-dysbiosis-and-innate-immune-response-to-promote-colorectal-tumorigenesis%2F) driven by the UPR signal transducer ATF6. To understand the role of the microbiome in ATF6-driven tumorigenesis, we utilise a combination of next-generation sequencing and unargeted metabolomics to identify functional mechanisms underlying disease. 

During my PhD, I have also developed a keen interest in Bioinformatics and analysis of large, complex datasets. To this end, we are applying machine learning and network science tools to generate additional insights into the data generated and to link complex multi-omics datasets. 

Outside of the lab I enjoy exploring my adopted home, trying and learning new things and playing guitar.
